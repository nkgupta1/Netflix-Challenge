This directory has the data files sorted by user first then movie.

all.dta        All 102,416,306 data points (including the qual points,
	       with their ratings blanked out as 0). Format explained
               below.

all.idx        Index of the lines in all.dta that specifies which
	       set that line comes from. The indices 1,2,3 designate
	       training set and 4,5 designate probe/qual sets. See
               explanation below.

qual.dta       The 2,749,898 test points in the same order as in
	       all.dta, with no ratings. 

example.dta    Example of a solution file that computes a real number
	       between 1.0 and 5.0 corresponding to each line, and in
	       the same order, of qual.dta. Your solution files in the
               same format as example.dta should be uploaded per class
               instructions in order to get the out-of-sample error
               posted on the score board.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Format of each line in all.dta:
(user number)       (movie number)       (date number)       (rating)

Format of each line in qual.dta:
(user number)       (movie number)       (date number)

where: user number is between 1 and 458,293
       movie number is between 1 and 17,770
       date number is between 1 and 2243 (in days): Day 1 is Thursday,
       	    Nov 11, 1999, and Day 2243 is Saturday, December 31, 2005.
       rating is between 1 and 5 (integer). 0 means blanked-out rating.

Explanation of indices for different sets:

1: base (96% of the training set picked at random, use freely)
2: valid (2% of the training set picked at random, use freely)
3: hidden (2% of the training set picked at random, use freely)
4: probe (1/3 of the test set picked at random, use freely but carefully)
5: qual (2/3 of the test set picked at random, for testing the results)
